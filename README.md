# QState-Preparation
This is Quantum State Preparation, without using any high-level quantum libraries (e.g., Qiskit), and using NumPy for numerical computations, focusing on fundamental quantum computing concepts: normalization of amplitudes, tensor products for multi-qubit state construction, and matrix-vector representations for state vectors.
